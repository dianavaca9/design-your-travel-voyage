If you are flying, depending on the destination and time of year, or if any holidays are present, your flights could be on the more pricier or less expensive side. 

**International Flights** - These flight prices will for sure start off at around $700+ per person.
- be prepared for jet lag
- extra money incase flights get cancelled
- always try and book flights months in advance for a more affordable flight!

**Domestic Flights** - These are dependent on time of year, but they can fall in between $300-$800 per person.
- extra money incase of flight cancellation
- also book flights in advance

At your destination you may want to consider using the bus, or subway, if one is available rather than Uber or Taxi as these can really bring your budget **WAY** up. 
You may even want to consider a car rental. 

**QUICK TIP TO KNOW**
==If you book trips on Wednesday's, they tend to be a little cheaper than other days of the week!==

After going through the steps of budgeting, my [[budgeting-your-trip/Accomadations|starting budget]] was $6k, and my final ultimate budget is $3,400.
