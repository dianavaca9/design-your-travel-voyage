# All-Inclusive Resort Food and Beverage

If you're staying at a All Inclusive Hotel, food and drinks may not be a problem at all considering they are all included in the purchase of your [[Accomadations]].

Typically resort food and drinks are fancy looking and may look like the following:

If you dont have an all incusive hotel, you might have a hotel that offers free breakfast. You would then only budget lunch and dinner. 

Or you may have an Airbnb. If this is the case, you have a fridge and a stove. You may want to consider purchasing groceries, if there is a lot of people. It doesn't have to be pricey either. The grocery costs could be split. 

And last but not least if you are staying at a hostel and solo travel, the most cost effective food may be street vendors and or fast food places. 

On average my fiance and I like to find new places to eat, including breakfast. I would avergae about $500.
