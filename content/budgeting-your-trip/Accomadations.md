# Hotels, Airbnb's and Hostels

## How to know what place to stay is best for you?

The First Step in budgeting your trip is knowing how many people are traveling with you, and where its is you need to find accommadation. Is it a big family vacation? Or is it a bachelorette party? Or maybe its just you and a friend or significant other. Or maybe you just enjoy traveling alone, and made this a solo trip. 

### Hotels

You could get a hotel in the city, and only have breakfast included. You could also get an all inclusive hotel by the beach, and have all breakfasts, lunch's, dinners and drinks included as well. This is perfect for a solo trip up to about 4 family members, I would say. Having [[Food and Drinks]] in a hotel that you already paid for the inclusive part is such a great perk of staying at all inclusive hotels!

#### Airbnb's

Knowing how many people you are bringing along is highly important as, you wouldn't book an entire Airbnb house just for 1 person. That might be a little on the pricier side. Now as for a  bachelorette party, an Airbnb house will be perfect! It could be cost effective, and split into everyone for a lower price per person, and just a more simple way of throwing a party, at the same place you are sleeping at!

##### Hostels

Hostels are rooms you share with other people. Think about college dorm rooms almost. These are perfect for solo travelers, backpackers etc. It is a low cost form of living, while traveling, as you can share these dormitories with other, or even have a private room to yourself as well. 

I am personally a big solo traveler, so depending on the time of year and avergae location, a hotel for me and my fiance could be around $600 USD. We don't look for much in hotels, (of course when ==not== staying at a all inclusive resort) as we like to spend our entire time exploring the new destination we arrived at!
