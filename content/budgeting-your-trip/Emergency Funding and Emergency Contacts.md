# Emergency Funding

Its always important to consider any unforeseen emergencies come up in your trip. 
For example, lets say you don't budget the trip you're going on. You just bring a limited amount of money, and you end up overspending, but atleast you could have some emergency funding to fall back on. But then lets say, you overspent, so now you are using your emergency money, but then you have a unplanned hospital visit.... then you are in for more money again that you may or may not be able to afford. 

This is why having a [[budgeting-your-trip/index|budget]] and a emergency fund as two separate things can help you, incase of emergencies like this. 

Emergency funding that i always put aside is 25% of my total budget. 

Emergency money is the #1 thing i prioritize and make sure is fully funded before i even think about taking a trip.
