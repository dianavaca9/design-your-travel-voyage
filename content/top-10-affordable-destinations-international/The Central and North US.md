# Oklahoma

- Home to the multiple of indigenous tribes! Oklahoma has beautiful mountains as well, oerfect for hiking. A popular place is Broken Bow, Oklahoma. Next to that another place Oklahoma is known for is the biggest casino in the US, WinStar World Casino located in the heart of Thackerville, OK. (Only about an hour and 20 minute drive from Dallas, TX!) The [[Activities and Excursions]] are endless here!

Oklahoma is **affordable** if you want to go hiking, but if you are planning on gambling, you may need some extra cash!!

## Illinois

- Specifically recommended, Chicago, WINDY CITY! Chicago has beautiful tall city buildings. Chicago is famous for their Architecture, and Culture, their food (hot dogs!!) and their new skyscrapers. Tickets to Chicago can get pricey around october-december, but the rest of the year is at a pretty affordable rate!
