# Florida

- Florida! The. Best. Beaches. It has clear white sand beaches with blue water. If you book with a year in advance, this is the perfect family vacation! Florida popular locations include: 

- Miami, Fl
- Pensacola, Fl
- Orlando, Fl

Florida is also home to Walt Disney World, the magical place, with so many attractions for kids, even adults!


## TEXAS

- My home state, and the second largest state in the USA! Texas is home to the Dallas Cowboys, The Dr Pepper Museum in Dallas, TX and the Houston Astros and so much more. It also has the beaches down by Galveston, Tx all the way to the border, South Padre Island! Texas is one of the best states in the USA, and Im probably being bias because i live here!

Texas is probably one of the most affordable states, as a lot of people from California are even permanently moving down here!
