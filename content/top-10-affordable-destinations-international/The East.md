# Massachusetts

Massachusetts would be perfect for an October get away. This state has tales from so long ago about the Salem witches that were hung, and so every year in Salem, MA, the streets are beautiful fall colored, the air smells of delicious matcha and iced coffees, and leaves falling everywhere. The Salem Witches are remembered and the houses are decorated for halloween and tourists are visiting for the scandal of it all! 

Going to Massachusetts is ideally more of a Fall time of the year travel. DONT miss it!

**FUN FACT**
- If you have ever seen the movie "Hocus Pocus" the setting is based out of Salem, Massachusetts!

## Pennsylvania

If you are a history lover, this affordable place is for you! The state of Pennsylvania is the home to the Declaration Of Independence, as well as one of the original 13 colonies. Its small but very important and loved state here in the USA!
